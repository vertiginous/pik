== REQUIREMENTS:

*  Windows

*  Development requirements:

      ruby 1.8.7-p330[http://rubyinstaller.org]

      rake:    gem install rake
      isolate: gem install isolate

      exerb-mingw[http://vert.igino.us/2011/01/05/exerb-101-building-windows-executables-with-ruby/]

      upx[http://upx.sourceforge.net/] (downloaded automatically, as needed)

      wix 3.5[http://wix.sourceforge.net/] (downloaded automatically, as needed)

      
== INSTALL:
  
You can install pik via rubygems, or the Windows installer, or you can update pik with pik

=== Install pik using rubygems

    >gem install pik
    ...
   
    Successfully installed pik-0.3.0
    1 gem installed

After the gem is installed, you can use the 'pik_install' script to install the pik executable.  Install pik to a location that's in your path, but someplace other than your ruby\bin dir.  For instance, the directory C:\bin is in my path:

    >path
    PATH=c:\bin;C:\Program Files\Windows Resource Kits\Tools\;c:\ruby\Ruby-186-p383\bin;
   
So I run:

    >pik_install C:\bin
    Thank you for using pik.
   
    Installing to C:\bin
     
    ...
     
    pik is installed

=== Install pik using the installer

If you want to install to a machine that doesn't have Ruby installed yet, you can download the latest msi file from github[http://github.com/vertiginous/pik/downloads].

The MSI installer currently doesn't install the needed files to use Pik from Git Bash. 

If you want to install to a directory that's not in your path, you can check the box to have the installer add it to the path for you (this will only work if you're an adminstrator).  After that, you should be ready to run pik. 

*  If this is a first-time install, look at pik add, and pik install to set up your environment.
